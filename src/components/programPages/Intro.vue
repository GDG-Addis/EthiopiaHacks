            <p>
              ‚ÄúEthiopia Hack‚Äù Hackathon v1.0 is one of the 12 hackathon programs
              and it was conducted from Nov 16th to Nov 18 th, 2018 at American Center,
              inside NALA, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
            </p>

            <h3 class="display-1">Problem Statement</h3>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>
                ‚ÄúIn Ethiopia plenty of trucks (1.5 ‚Äì 40.0 tons) are driving empty in one direction to reach
                their destination e.g. Djibouti. This increased cost and wear and tear of tires and
                equipment without generating revenue. On the same road potential customers are waiting
                for transport so that their goods will be transported to the next town, etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                A system should be developed that addresses the issue by which customers can call
                (USSD or call center) and ask for a transport service. This call will go out to drivers that
                are in the nearby area. The system will have registered about 5,000 certified truck
                drivers with their certified trucks incl. load capacity. If the driver agrees, he will receive
                further instructions and a contract will be signed using USSD. Distances and prices are
                calculated based on a standardized pricing system. After the customer and driver are
                satisfied (a feedback is given by the customer and the truck driver) with the agreed
                service the contract amount will be transferred via mobile money. The public can see the
                satisfaction of the customer with the driver and the delivery of goods. The application
                needs to be developed in at last three local languages.
              </p>

              <p>
                With this application the prices for the service can be reduced over time while the income
                for the truck drivers can increase. As truck drivers get regular information about
                potential clients they are better informed and can adequately make business decisions.‚Äù
